# BWS (******B******eautiful and **W**holesome **S**erver)

## Mission

[*Be better than feather and quartz*](https://github.com/Rusty-Quartz/Quartz#mission-statement)

Jokes aside, the goal is a very minimal and performant Minecraft server with a very powerful and extensible plugin system, all in Rust. The actual BWS shouldn't be much more than just glue for plugins.
