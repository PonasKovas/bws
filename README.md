Welcome to **BWS**, the ultimate solution for creating performant, extendable, and reliable Minecraft servers! We're not just building servers here, we're constructing dreams. Crafted with love, passion, and a fair bit of Rust-inspired wizardry, BWS is the Merlin of Minecraft server frameworks.

Ever wished for a Minecraft server that runs smoother than a well-oiled minecart? Dreamt of a world where "server crash" is as unheard of as a pacifist Creeper? Yearned for a community of like-minded, dedicated server administrators and developers? Welcome home, you're among friends.

## 🧠 What's Under The Hood
BWS isn't just a pretty face. Underneath its charming exterior lies a beast of a framework built with the speed and safety of Rust. Rust's performance characteristics make it an ideal choice for a game server framework, ensuring lightning-fast response times and an all-around reliable server experience.

## 📊 Benchmark
_"To BWS or not to BWS, that's not even a question."_ - Shakespeare if he were a Minecraft server admin.

Here's why:

| Server | TPS* | Memory Usage | CPU Usage |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ | --------- |
| BWS    | 20.0 | 512MB        | 10%       |
| Others | 17.4 | 1GB          | 30%       |

\*TPS: Ticks Per Second
